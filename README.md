This is a collection of code written throughout my studies at the **School For Poetic Computation** in NYC in Spring 2018.

Classes attended:
 -  **Critical Thinking of Technology** by [Morehshin Allahyari](http://www.morehshin.com/)
This is a theory course for critical thinking of technology through the lens of activism, politics, and the 'outside'; to think and create beyond technology for technology's sake; to ask difficult questions; to read, learn, and engage in technology as a field of contemporary art practices and theories, as well as art historical systems. What will separate this course from many others is a collective effort (by all of us) for 'reflective thinking'; to not find comfort in how - up to this very day - the story of technology is told to us; by which figures and which systems. I hope that together we can build a new library of critical thinking and reading; written and processed by women (+LGBT) and POC. This is a collaborative course for interrupting and re-building.

 -  **Open Frameworks** by [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/)

 -  **Poetic Hardware** by [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com/])

 We will be soldering and breadboard. We will provide the basic materials and tools (soldering irons, wire cutters, oscilloscope, multimeters, power supplies), but if you have your own, feel free please bring them. You will need to use an Arduino for a class assignment in mid-March. We are not going to provide Arduinos for free, you will have an option to purchase your own or borrow from us.

 -  **Artistic Crafts** by [Kelli Anderson](http://kellianderson.com/) [Robby Craft](http://robbykraft.com/) [Pamala Liou](http://pamelaliou.com/)
